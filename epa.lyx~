 nudivirus as Biological Control Agents for Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle on

\begin_layout Enumerate
Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), 
\emph on
Oryctes rhinoceros
\emph default
, a major pest of coconut and other palms, was first detected on Guam in
 2007.
 Adults bore into the crowns of palms to feed on sap, causing mortality
 if they destroy the meristem.
 CRB grubs do no economic damage.
 They feed in dead coconut stems, fallen logs, and any material high in
 organic content such as green waste, manure, sawdust, and soil.
 Guam is currently experiencing an uncontrolled and unmonitored CRB outbreak
 triggered by abundant breeding sites left in the wake of a recent typhoon.
 Many palms have already been killed island-wide,

.
 If the current outbreak cannot be controlled, it is likely that Guam will
 loose 50% or more of its palms, as happened when Palau was invaded by CRB
 at the end of WWII.
 It is also likely that CRB will be accidentally exported to other islands.
 The CRB outbreak prompted Governor Calvo to declare a

The insect pathogens, 
\emph on
Oryctes rhinoceros 
\emph default
nudivirus, OrNV, and 
\emph on
Metarhizium majus
\emph default
, also known as green muscardine fungus, GMF, are biological control agents
 for CRB.
 OrNV is applied by autodissemination as a classical, innoculative biocontrol
 agent.
 GMF is used as an augmentive biocontrol agent by incorporating spores into
 active or potential CRB breeding sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Humans have lived with 
\emph on
Metarhizium majus
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Oryctes 
\emph default
nudivirus for thousands of years.
 No adverse human health effects have been reported.
 These insect pathogens are not genetically engineered organisms nor are
 they synthetic pesticides.
 They have always been part of the human environment in the native range
 of CRB, which includes Souteast Asia including the Philippines.
 These biocontrol agents have also been introduced to many Pacific islands
 following CRB invasions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The total amount of active ingredient applied to the environment is minuscule.
 In an island-wide biocontrol program using GMF, a few milligrams of spores
 will be used.
 In the case of OrNV, a few nanograms of virus particles will be used.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Both 
\emph on
M.

\emph default
 and OrNV are known to attack only dynastid beetles.
 The coconut rhinoceros beetle is the only member of Dynastidae on Guam.
 This high degree of host specificity is highly desired for insect pathogens
 used as biocontrol agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There are no reports of nontarget effects following release of 
\emph on

 and OrNV as biocontrol agents on Guam, on other Pacific islands and elsewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Perceived, potential risks to human health and the environment from exposure
 to 
\emph on
M.
 majus
\emph default
 and OrNV should be balanced against the known risks to human health and
 the environment from the loss of coconut palms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
M.
 majus
\emph default
 and OrNV are regulated as biocontrol agents by USDA-APHIS.
 Perhaps regulation of these same biocontrol agents by USEPA is an unnecessary
 duplication of effort.
 Both 
\emph on
M.
 majus
\emph default
 and OrNV have been imported to Guam and released under conditions of permits
 received from USDA-APHIS.

 A

 indicates that between 10% and 38% of CRB are being killed by fungal infections
 caused by 
\emph on
M.
 majus
\emph default
.
 Unfortunately, this level of population suppression is too low to counteract
 the current outbreak triggered by abundant new breeding sites left in the
 wakr of Typhoon Dolphin.
 We are hoping to implement effective biocontrol using an OrNV isolate which
 is highly pathogenic for CRB on Guam.
